# Data pipeline task

Due to some unfortunate circumstances, we are unable to run MinIO server and getting 'API: SYSTEM()' error. We tried to debug through the internet and tried every possible website but no one has solved this issue on the internet as well.

It consume about 2 hours of our valuable time, so we dicuss this issue with xloop and came to a conclusion that they allowed us to do this task on a single system which was available at that time. 3 students faced the same issue so we done it on the same system and we are citing their names here. It was very late in the night and we dont have access to our Emeritus trainer as well to resolve this issue.

We hope you guys will understand the situation and can give us the relieve for this question only.
